# Ultrasonic Radar Scanner

## Highlights
- Reads distance values from an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo
- Sends data over a serial interface to a Bolt module
- Data is transmitted wirelessly to a frontend application
- Frontend application plots the data on a graph to provide an outline of the immediate environment

## Description
This project involves a radar scanner that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo to read distance values. The data is then sent over a serial interface to a Bolt module, which wirelessly transmits the data to a frontend application. The frontend application plots the data on a graph, providing an outline of the immediate environment.

## Usage
This project combines hardware and software components to create an ultrasonic radar scanner that can be used for various applications such as object detection, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping. The radar scanner can be easily customized and integrated into other projects for different use cases.
